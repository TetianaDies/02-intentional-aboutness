 # Vital project
 
Make it simple and true, my basic rules in design. Based on this, I helped to bring one project to life.
#### Ukrainian charity project “The world of children's hopes” where I worked as part of the Cherkasy regional
art museum (Ukraine). The idea of the project is to create positive emotions in children who are being 
treated at the Regional Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology of the Cherkasy Regional Oncology Center.
A positive-minded child can more easily endure pain and suffering than a child who doesn't believe in healing.
The main goal wasn't to advertise any diseases, but just make children happy.
