 ## Vital project
 
Make it simple and true, my basic rules in design. Based on this, I helped to bring one project to life.
*Ukrainian charity project “The world of children's hopes”*  where I worked as part of the Cherkasy regional
art museum (Ukraine). The idea of the project is to *create positive emotions* in children who are being 
treated at the Regional Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology of the Cherkasy Regional Oncology Center.
A positive-minded child can more easily endure pain and suffering than a child who doesn't believe in healing.
The main goal wasn't to advertise any diseases, but just make children happy.

## Not just coloring book

Beyond creating visual content, I was working on creating a coloring book for children.

This coloring was made on the basis of drawings of sick children, who drew fantastic animals.The coloring 
book was printed like a limited edition and was given to children for free. The best drawings of *fantastic 
animals were exhibited at the Cherkasy regional art museum (Ukraine).*
The best children's drawings received a reward. It was a lot of fun to watch them try to explain what they drew.

## Design that makes sense

It's impossible to discuss the success of the project, because all children who took part in the project 
had little chance of recovery, but even such a small thing as a coloring book with unreal animals brought
them a lot of joy. Also as part of the project I had the opportunity to express themselves and 
as a photographer. All the photos that I took, were printed in many magazines.
My motivation when I working on the project was huge, because at that moment for me the design wasn't 
just making a new logo, poster and illustration, it was a real, true story behind these children
a story of pain and hope. I try to make designs that really benefit people and I love my job.
